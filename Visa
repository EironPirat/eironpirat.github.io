Visa... nearly everybody got one, now I even got two. apart from the normal Visa card, today my visa confirmation for the Sultanate of oman finanlly arrived. A month of waiting, whining and wondering whistfully wears away. With this fancy visa i wont be able to pick up money but, as we germans are knownz fors ourz hummer, I shall become "stone rich". Ya, well jokes aside my next steps (apart from finishing my thesis) are to book the flight. Its now 2 Weeks to take-off, so it might just be about the right time to do so. And astonishingly, the flights arent all too high. well compared to what they were before. A one way trip is priced around 450€ while booking 6 months in advance gives you a price of around 300€. Thats quite allright. insert picture flights. Just checked on expedia, germanwebsite for spring break trips, the cheapest round trip is with turkish airlines via istanbul. Thats where his excellent Highness King Prime minister resides.. and one might not be allowed in to the country. But thats a different take and we are trying to be serious here right? Politics are always dangerous if you publicly announce your opinion. Now that thats all said, let me get back to typing down some more words for my final thesis.
