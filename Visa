Visa... nearly everybody got one, now I even got two. apart from the normal Visa card, today my visa confirmation for the Sultanate of oman finanlly arrived. A month of waiting, whining and wondering whistfully wears away. With this fancy visa i wont be able to pick up money but, as we germans are knownz fors ourz hummer, I shall become "stone rich". Ya, well jokes aside my next steps (apart from finishing my thesis) are to book the flight. Its now 2 Weeks to take-off, so it might just be about the right time to do so. And astonishingly, the flights arent all too high. well compared to what they were before.
